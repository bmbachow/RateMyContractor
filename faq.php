          There are Three ways in which a user can find a local contractor in their area:
1) From the homepage there will be Three fields for you to fill in. They are “category” or “keyword” and “zip
code.” Depending on what your project keywords are specific contractors will show up on
the results page.
2) The other way is to browse. Once on the homepage, click services in the top right of the page and
choose cordially. You can then go on to sort them by rating, RMC certified, zip code, etc.

          “RMC Certified” means that we’ve made your job easier. We’ve done the busy work for you so that the
necessary credentials, licenses, and certifications have all been checked. We’ve also have a partner
website whom conducts an extensive background check to ensure that the contractor is credible. RMC
certified also tells you, as a homeowner, that the contractor is in good standing with other homeowners in
the area.

          Before the birth of Rate My Contractor we knew that the accuracy of reliable reviews was going to be our
number one priority. In order to ensure the highest quality and accuracy, our team randomly checks the
authenticity of each its reviews. We’ve also have a custom software programing in place to prevent users
from cheating the system.
Because Rate My Contractor is community based, there is a “Red Flag” system that lets users flag reviews
for investigation by one of Rate My Contractor’s authenticity investigation team members. However, if we
discover that people are not abiding to our code of standards, Rate My Contractor reserves the right to
suspend account use and be noted on their listing, specifically contractor profiles.
