      <h3 id="textleft" class="text text-center">Culture</h3>
        <p>We thrive on the competive spirit. We work hard and play hard. The company was founded on maternal capitalism. The idea that everyone from the janitor to the CEO will take an equal share in the yearly profits. Though it sounds idealistic this is how all businesses should think in the 21st century. Too long have big businesses been over paying their top management with big bonuses and not taking care of what matters most, their employees.</p>

        <p>We are looking for the next generation of potential to fill our humble positions. We want the best and the brightest to take on careers their passionate about. We want people who are looking for a career not a job and are willing to work to get where they want. These people should have a great attitude, like challenges, and have a competitive spirt. They should be enthusiastic, optimistic, and generally outgoing, though we see potential in everyone. If you like what you hear apply for a job today.</p>
